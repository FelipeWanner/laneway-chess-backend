To ensure that the authentication and token refresh functionality works correctly, 
you'll want to perform a series of tests using Postman. 
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on the tests you should perform and how to do them:

1 Register a New User
Test Purpose: Verify that the user registration endpoint works and returns both an 
access token and a refresh token.

Open Postman and create a new POST request.

Set the URL to http://localhost:5000/api/register.

Go to the Body tab:

Select raw and choose JSON from the dropdown.
Add the Request Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "testuser@example.com",
  "password": "TestPassword123"
}

Send the Request.

Check the Response:

Ensure you receive both accessToken and refreshToken in the response body.
The status should be 200 OK.

=====================================================================================================

2. Log In with the Registered User
Test Purpose: Ensure that the login endpoint works and returns new tokens.

Create a new POST request in Postman.

Set the URL to http://localhost:5000/api/login.

Go to the Body tab:

Select raw and choose JSON.
Add the Request Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "email": "testuser@example.com",
  "password": "TestPassword123"
}
Send the Request.

Check the Response:

Ensure you receive both accessToken and refreshToken in the response.
The status should be 200 OK.

=====================================================================================================

3. Access a Protected Route with the Access Token
Test Purpose: Verify that the access token works for accessing protected routes.

Create a new GET request in Postman.
Set the URL to http://localhost:5000/api/profile/me.

Go to the Headers tab:

Add a header with 
Key: x-auth-token and 
Value: [your_access_token] (copy the access token from the login or register response).

Send the Request.

Check the Response:
The status should be 200 OK, and you should receive the user's profile data in the response.

=====================================================================================================

4. Test Access Without a Token
Test Purpose: Ensure that access to protected routes is denied when no token is provided.

Create a new GET request in Postman.

Set the URL to http://localhost:5000/api/profile/me.

Do not include any headers.

Send the Request.

Check the Response:

The status should be 401 Unauthorized, with a message like "No token, authorization denied".

=====================================================================================================

5. Test Access with an Invalid Token
Test Purpose: Ensure that access is denied when an invalid token is provided.

Create a new GET request in Postman.

Set the URL to http://localhost:5000/api/profile/me.

Go to the Headers tab:

Add a header with 
Key: x-auth-token and 
Value: InvalidTokenHere.

Send the Request.

Check the Response:

The status should be 401 Unauthorized, with a message like "Token is not valid".

=====================================================================================================

6. Refresh the Access Token Using the Refresh Token
Test Purpose: Ensure that you can generate a new access token using the refresh token.

Create a new POST request in Postman.

Set the URL to http://localhost:5000/api/token.

Go to the Body tab:

Select raw and choose JSON.
Add the Request Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "refreshToken": "[your_refresh_token]" // Replace with the actual refresh token you received earlier
}

Send the Request.

Check the Response:

The status should be 200 OK, and you should receive a new accessToken in the response.

=====================================================================================================

7. Test Token Refresh Handling Near Expiration
Test Purpose: Ensure that the refresh token is updated if it's close to expiration.

Manually modify the expiration time of the refresh token (e.g., set it to expire in the next few seconds) in your database for testing.

Use the shortened refresh token to request a new access token by repeating the steps in the previous test.

Check if a new refresh token is returned in the response headers.

The response should include a new refresh token if the original one was close to expiration.

=====================================================================================================

Summary of Tests:
Register a New User: Ensure user registration returns tokens.
Log In: Ensure login returns new tokens.
Access Protected Route: Test access with a valid token.
Access Without a Token: Confirm that access is denied.
Access with an Invalid Token: Confirm that access is denied.
Refresh Token: Ensure you can get a new access token using a refresh token.
Near Expiration Handling: Verify that the refresh token is renewed close to expiration.
